Challenge 4 - Day 50 - https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/5/3/challenge

Your challenge is to put two different projects into one: Iâ€™d like you to let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1. So, your finished project needs to use elements from both project 1 and project 12, which should give you ample chance to practice.

This will require you to use the picker.sourceType = .camera setting for your image picker controller, create a custom type that stores a filename and a caption, then show the list of saved pictures in a table view. Remember: using the camera is only possible on a physical device.
